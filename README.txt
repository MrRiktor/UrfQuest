For those who wish to work with our code:

If you do download it and intend to use it please give us the credit we deserve, there were alot of long nights spent on this and we have come to see it more of a child of our creation rather than just a simple program/game.

An important note: If you wish to use our program there are some things you'll have to do in order to get it working out of the box. The API key field in RiotAPIConstants.cs is empty and therefore you must put your own key into that field. We make 9 API calls to get to the team select screen since we have to grab each individual match (8 calls) plus getting champion static data (1 call). So just keep that in mind before spamming team select.
