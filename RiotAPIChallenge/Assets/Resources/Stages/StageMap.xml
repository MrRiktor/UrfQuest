      <StageStory>The day was April 1st, and there was no doubt in anyone's mind that something was fishy on Summoner's Rift.  The smell of the ocean permeated through everyone's nostrils, but all that could be seen was the rift.  The fishy smell was more than just a notification in the brain that something was off, the pungent aroma sent a surge through every champion increasing their already unhuman fighting abilities.  For weeks, a trail of death and destruction like had never been seen before decorated Summoner's Rift.  At first it was confusing, but that confusion quickly turned into fun with horror quickly setting in.  How long can this craziness go on?  It needed to be stopped. The fishy smell that bolstered the champions must be emanating from the long forgotten URF, but this could not be… could it?  Warwick slayed the beast many many years ago, perhaps realizing the damage he would cause in time.  Somehow he is destroying the rift from the beyond.  YOU MUST STOP HIM!  The monsters of Summoner's Rift are happy to protect their unseen master, so in order for you to complete your quest you must defeat them and learn where this manatee is hiding.  Good luck Summoner!</StageStory>

Your next opponent will be a much greater challenge.  The minions have divulged to you that the wolves may have more information on the whereabouts of the fish mammal beast.</StageStory>

      <StageStory>Finally those dinos have been put down.  You are one step closer.  Be warned though, it only gets harder from here.  You can run away and hide under your seat with a popcorn tub on your head if you would like.  However, if you would like to continue, before the raptors died you saw them head toward their rock defenders.  Strike Krug down and get closer to winning the day.</StageStory>
